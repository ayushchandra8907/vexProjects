# vexProjects

All shared projects written in VEXcode v5 and PROS for VEX Robotics. Things such as main code or templates for future projects are made here for ease of sharing and making sure I don't recode something I've coded in the past. Port motors are not specified, and will usually default to RFM - 1, RBM - 2, LFM - 3, LBM - 4. Additonally, projects that are written in the PROS editor will be marked with PROS at the end.
